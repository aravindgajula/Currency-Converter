Currency Converter – Description & Explanation

A Currency Converter is a web application that helps users convert money from one currency to another using the latest exchange rates. This project allows users to select a source currency, a target currency, and enter an amount to instantly get the converted value.

The application works by fetching real-time exchange rate data from a currency exchange API. When the user selects currencies and enters an amount, JavaScript calculates the conversion using the current rate and displays the result dynamically without reloading the page.

The project is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for logic, API integration, and DOM manipulation. Country flags are displayed alongside currency options to improve user experience and make currency selection more intuitive.

This currency converter is responsive, meaning it works smoothly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. It is lightweight, easy to use, and suitable for beginners who want to understand how APIs, user input handling, and real-time data updates work in web development.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills such as API handling, event handling, dynamic UI updates, and responsive design, making it a useful addition to a developer’s portfolio.
